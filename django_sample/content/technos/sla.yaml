description: SLA machines are built around a large tank containing the liquid photopolymer (resin),
    and the build platform. The UV laser focuses onto the surface of the resin,
    tracing a cross-section of the 3D model.


    The build platform then descends a distance equal to the thickness of a single layer,
    and a resin-filled blade sweeps across the vat to recoat it with fresh material.
    The process builds consecutive layers on top of the others until the part is finished.


    This methods is ideal for making rapid, one-off prototypes in plastic, especially for transparent parts.
    These prototypes can be used as-is, or to function as master patterns for our vacuum casting process.


    Like with other 3D additive manufacturing processes, you can add complex internal features that can’t be made using traditional plastic manufacturing.

# list of benefits
benefit_titles:
    - Smooth surface finish
    - Accurate and repeatable
    - Scalable
    - Transparent

benefit_descriptions:
    - SLA creates parts with a smooth surface finish directly out the machine. This is ideal for applications that require a flawless finish, and also helps reduce finishing time, since parts can easily be sanded, polished and painted.
    - SLA printers can create accurate parts with repeatable dimensions. This is essential for functional applications, such engineering assemblies, jewelry casting masters, or custom dental products from a patient’s scan.
    - Because of its repeatability and high speed, especially for derivative technololgies such as DLP and CLIP, SLA is a good mean to produce small to medium batches.
    - SLA is the only process providing full transparency of the parts.
