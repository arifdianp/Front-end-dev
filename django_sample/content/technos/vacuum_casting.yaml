description: Vacuum Casting is a fast and cost-effective prototyping method for producing small numbers of highly accurate polyurethane prototype parts.
    Characteristics and quality are comparable to the final product. Vaccum casting is typically used to produce small numbers (usually up to 20) of highly accurate polyurethane prototype parts.

# list of benefits
benefit_titles:
    - Ideal for functional testing
    - Versatile
    - Low volume runs


benefit_descriptions:
    - The mould is made from silicone rubber, and the casting made by pouring resin into the mould in a vacuum chamber.
        The result is a bubble free casting, ideal for highly accurate, functional plastic prototype parts in very fine detail which replicate patterns, dimensions, profiles and textures.
    - Vacuum Casting can also produce parts with varying degrees of flexibility or rigidity, in a wide range of colours and materials – as well clear parts.
    - Vacuum Casting is a rapid and cost-effective prototyping method for producing small numbers of highly accurate polyurethane prototype parts.
