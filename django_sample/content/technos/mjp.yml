description: MJP or MultiJet Printing is an inkjet printing process that uses piezo printhead technology
    to deposit either photocurable plastic resin or casting wax materials layer by layer.
    MJP is used to build parts, patterns and molds with fine feature detail to address a wide range of applications.
    These high-resolution printers are economical to own and operate and use a separate,
    meltable or dissolvable support material to make post-processing a breeze.
    Another big benefit is that removing support material is virtually a hands-free operation
    and allows even the most delicate features and complex internal cavities to be thoroughly cleaned without damage.
