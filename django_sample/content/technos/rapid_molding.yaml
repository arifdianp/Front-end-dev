description: Injection molding is a high speed, automated and versatile process that can produce
    high precision complex three dimensional parts from any plastic material. The injection molding
    process is very fast and economical for mass production.


    However injection molding tools take from weeks to months to build. Very often, design mistakes are
    made and mold changes are needed. Tools may go back and forth a few times from the producer to the
    tool builder until the final part design and quality are achieved, increasing costs and
    product time-to-market.


    To solve this issue and produce your prototypes by injection with the actual final material, just choose Rapid Molding.
    We 3D printed a mold with high-temperature thermoset material to inject your part.

# list of benefits
benefit_titles:
    - Use of injection material
    - Smooth Surface
    - Small production volume

benefit_descriptions:
    - With Rapid Molding you can use and test the actual material selected for the mass production. Using high
        temperature termoset material to produce the mold core & cavities with a deflexion temperature of 269°C, we enable you
        to use a wide range of materials.
    - The use of the SLA technology to produce the mold provide the smoothest surface quality with a dimensional accuracy as
        low as 50 microns.
    - Launch a small pre-series with your rapid mold, up to 100 units can be produce.
