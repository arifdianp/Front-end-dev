    - Direct Digital manufacturing

benefit_descriptions:
    - Because DMLS printers can print in metal, they are widely used for rapid tooling, i.e., creating fixtures and jigs.
    - DMLS printers are used to make proof of concept models and fully functional late-stage prototypes.
    - High-quality finish and durable materials have made DMLS printing a favorite technology for end-use products.
