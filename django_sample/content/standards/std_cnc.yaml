    +.150mm/-.150mm local tolerances across most geometries. +.010/-.010mm for plastics. Will vary for large parts, specifically when holding flatness over large parts after heat treatment.


    Finish requirements for “As Milled” finish will have a minimum 125 surface finish for CNC parts.

    Tapped holes not explicitly called out as Features on the quoted CAD model may be machined to the diameters specified in that model.

    Minimum wall thicknesses are expected to be 0.5mm for metals, 0.8mm for plastics.

    No surface treatments (e.g. anodize, bead blast, iridite, powder coat, etc.) will be applied unless you have paid for them and we have specifically acknowledged them.
