    +/- 0.250mm or +/- 0.080mm per mm, whichever is larger, is typical. Irregular or overly-thick geometries may cause deviances or deflection due to shrinkage.


    A shrinkage rate of +0.15% can be expected due to thermal expansion of the liquid, and the response of the flexible mold.


    Surface finish is external smoothed to a satin or matte surface. Grow lines may be present on internal or difficult-to-access features. Polishing or custom finishes must be clearly defined and agreed upon at the point of order.
    We can offer urethane casted parts as large as 600mm long.
