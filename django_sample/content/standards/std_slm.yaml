    +/- 0.050mm is typical for positive features, and +/- 0.100mm â€“ 0.150mm for negative features such as holes, but will vary between geometries and materials (e.g. stainless versus aluminum).


    Stress, supports and other geometry considerations may cause deviation in tolerances and flatness.  Items and geometries which require strict flatness are not a good fit for this process.


    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 250mm x 230mm.
