    +/- 0.150mm or +/- 0.050mm per mm, whichever is greater. Build area up to 330mm x 330mm x 400mm.


    Parts with thicker geometries, large broad parts, and parts with uneven wall thicknesses may deviate due to thermal shrinkage and stress.


    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 250 x 230mm. (100mm max dimension preferred).
