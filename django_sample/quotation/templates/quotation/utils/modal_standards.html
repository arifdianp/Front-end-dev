                    Unless we have agreed to other tolerances in your Quote, we will work to achieve and hold the tolerances noted below, which will vary per the primary manufacturing method you select.  Spare Parts 3D has developed a comprehensive set of Design Guides to assist you in optimizing your design for manufacturing method ultimately selected, please consult them for key tips and tricks.  In the event of a conflict between the Design Guides and this set of Spare Parts 3D Manufacturing Standards, these will control.

                <h4>CNC/Machining</h4>
                <p>
                    +.150mm/-.150mm local tolerances across most geometries. +.010/-.010mm for plastics. Will vary for large parts, specifically when holding flatness over large parts after heat treatment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Finish requirements for “As Milled” finish will have a minimum 125 surface finish for CNC parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tapped holes not explicitly called out as Features on the quoted CAD model may be machined to the diameters specified in that model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minimum wall thicknesses are expected to be 0.5mm for metals, 0.8mm for plastics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No surface treatments (e.g. anodize, bead blast, iridite, powder coat, etc.) will be applied unless you have paid for them and we have specifically acknowledged them.
                </p>
                <h3>Metal Additive Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>
                    Spare Parts 3D currently offers Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Sintered Laser Metal (SLM) to 3D print metals using additive manufacturing techniques.
                </p>
                <h4>DMLS</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.050mm is typical for positive features, and +/- 0.100mm – 0.150mm for negative features such as holes, but will vary between geometries and materials (e.g. stainless versus aluminum).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stress, supports and other geometry considerations may cause deviation in tolerances and flatness.  Items and geometries which require strict flatness are not a good fit for this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 250mm x 230mm.
                </p>
                <h4>SLM</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.050mm is typical for positive features, and +/- 0.100mm – 0.150mm for negative features such as holes, but will vary between geometries and materials (e.g. stainless versus aluminum).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stress, supports and other geometry considerations may cause deviation in tolerances and flatness.  Items and geometries which require strict flatness are not a good fit for this process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 250mm x 230mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spare Parts 3D currently offers SLS (Selective Laser Sintering), FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) and SLA (Stereolithography) across a range of machine and material combinations.
                </p>
                <h4>SLS</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.150mm or +/- 0.050mm per mm, whichever is greater. Build area up to 330mm x 330mm x 400mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parts with thicker geometries, large broad parts, and parts with uneven wall thicknesses may deviate due to thermal shrinkage and stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 250 x 230mm. (100mm max dimension preferred).
                </p>
                <h4>FDM</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.150mm or +/- 0.050mm per inch, whichever is greater. Build area up to 220mm x 130mm x 100mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minimum resolvable feature size, including positive text features, is at least 1.5mm (2mm or greater is safest).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretical maximum build volume of 250mm x 150mm x 150mm.
                </p>
                <h4>SLA</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.100mm, or +/- 0.0250mm per mm, whichever is greater. Build area up to 150mm x 150mm x 170mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretical maximum build volume of 110mm x 110mm x 150mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minimum feature size of 0.050” can be built with consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rubber-like materials represent an approximation of shore A values and may vary between geometries.
                </p>
                <h4>Urethane Casting</h4>
                <p>
                    +/- 0.250mm or +/- 0.080mm per mm, whichever is larger, is typical. Irregular or overly-thick geometries may cause deviances or deflection due to shrinkage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A shrinkage rate of +0.15% can be expected due to thermal expansion of the liquid, and the response of the flexible mold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surface finish is external smoothed to a satin or matte surface. Grow lines may be present on internal or difficult-to-access features. Polishing or custom finishes must be clearly defined and agreed upon at the point of order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can offer urethane casted parts as large as 600mm long.
                </p>
                <h4>Mating Parts</h4>
                <p>
                    Spare Parts 3D is not responsible for the fitment of mating parts.
